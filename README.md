### Steps to Run the App
I made a straightforward single screen app that loads data from the provided enpoint. If for some reason the data was corrupted or empty I display an error message along with a refresh button to try again. 
Recipe cards that have a source_url display a globe icon and "source" label to take the user to the recipe's original website.

### Focus Areas: What specific areas of the project did you prioritize? Why did you choose to focus on these areas?
I prioritized a clean UI. Personally, when an app's UI is too cluttered or hard to navigate it makes me not want to use the app again.

### Time Spent: Approximately how long did you spend working on this project? How did you allocate your time?
I spent about 8 hours working on this project. I spent a lot of time on Unit Testing. I've never made unit tests for my apps so I learned a lot and look forward to learning more about them.

### Trade-offs and Decisions: Did you make any significant trade-offs in your approach?
I wanted to utilize the youtube_url key for users to follow along recipes in video format, but I couldn't figure out a way to implement it without making my recipe card look too cluttered or without making a secondary screen.

### Weakest Part of the Project: What do you think is the weakest part of your project?
My weakest part of the project is my unit tests. I've never written unit tests before this project.

### External Code and Dependencies: Did you use any external code, libraries, or dependencies?
I used the Kingfisher SDK for image caching to reduce network usage. 

### Additional Information: Is there anything else we should know? Feel free to share any insights or constraints you encountered.
I thoroughly enjoyed this take home project and learned a few things from it. One constraint I encountered was the one screen limit. I had a few ideas in my head for the app but it required additional screens.
